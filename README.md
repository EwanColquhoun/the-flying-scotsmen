# Features

## Existing Features

### Home page

  * #### Navigation Bar

    * For displays over 980px the Navigation Bar is sited vertically on the left hand edge of all the pages. The Nav Bar can be toggled to expand to show the full name of the link instead of just the icon (default view) by clicking on the cheveron at the top of the Nav Bar.
    
    * For displays smaller than 980px the Nav Bar moves to a more traditional place at the top of the screen, with the links hidden and activated by a burger button to expand the menu for spaace saving.

      * A responsively styled carousel of images of group photos of the aircraft and teh various adventures the group has had.

    * An advanced model of the basic HTML Calendar. It contains features like, highlighted current day, color coded days representing the booking availability on that day and buttons to display the bookings on the selected day.
    * The page also has a 'Previous' and 'Next' month buttons for navigating the calendar.
    * On larger screen sizes the a simplified booking is displayed on the calender for enhanced UX.
    * When a date is clicked, a modal will appear at the top of the page displaying the bookings for that date. If there are no bookings, the modal will display accordingly. Each booking will display alongside an edit and a cancel booking button (only available if these bookings belong to the logged in user).

### Bookings

* #### Booking Display
    * At the top of the booking page is the list of bookings for the current logged in user.
    * The display has all the information pertinant to that booking as well as the edit and cancel buttons.
    * If there are no buttons there is some text explaining that the bookings will appear once approved by admin.

* #### Booking form
    * To make a new booking there is a form underneath the Booking display. It uses the logged-in users' username for the booking but the rest of the form is selectable. The booking information is then stored in the database pending admin approval.

The site was completed as a Portfolio 1 Project piece for the Full Stack Software Developer (e-Commerce) Diploma at the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). As such I would like to thank my mentor [Precious Ijege](https://www.linkedin.com/in/precious-ijege-908a00168/), the Slack community, and all at the Code Institute for their help and support. Wawas Woods is a fictional company but it exists in everything but the business title. Currently it is more of a hobby!
